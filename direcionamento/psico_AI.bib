abstract = {"Treat pre-disease " is one of the important ideas of Chinese medicine culture, and it is a scientific view of health based on the overall health of the human body. The application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of psychological counseling is still in its infancy. The integration of "preventive treatment" in psychology is an important part of Chinese medicine culture and health management, and it is one of the important theoretical foundations for constructing the theoretical system of Chinese medicine health. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of psychological counseling on the basis of the idea of "preventive treatment". This article introduces the related applications of artificial intelligence technology in the field of mental health at home and abroad, studies the feasibility and difficulties of artificial intelligence in psychological counseling, and proposes the application of artificial intelligence in psychological counseling in the future Several countermeasures and suggestions.},

abstract = {Since the 1950's, psychologists have studied the behavioral aspects of software engineering. However, the results of their research have never been organized into a subfield of either software engineering or psychology. This failure results from the difficulty of integrating theory and data from the mixture of paradigms borrowed from psychology. This paper will review some of the psychological research on software engineering performed since the Garmisch Conference in 1968. This review will be organized under two of the psychological paradigms used in exploring programming problems: individual differences and cognitive science. The major theoretical and practical contributions of each area to the theory and practice of software engineering will be discussed. The review will end with a call for more research guided by the paradigm of cognitive science, since such results are the easiest to integrate with new developments in artificial intelligence and computer science theory.},

w findings of human psychology and behavior's study. Nevertheless, the human- computer's multimodal interaction is actually a dynamic and evolutionary process, so there are still some difficult issues that need to be further explored such as how to comprehensively deal with the multimodal fusion data, adaptively consider the user's personalized habits, and precisely understand the expresser's intentions. NeuroManagement, an emerging interdisciplinary subject to study human's management based on neural mechanism, provides new theory and methodology for probing into the above issues. From the perspective of NeuroManagement, this keynote paper analyzes the user's neural mechanism of multimodal interactions, discusses the characteristics of neural activities in that process, and proposes a framework of intelligent computation method to understand and measure the user's intentions as well as his/her psychological states. In order to promote the interdisciplinary development of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, Neuroartificial Intelligence, a new subject field is proposed by this paper.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced more than 60 years of development and accumulated a strong technical foundation. In the past ten years, AI has gone through computational intelligence and perceptual intelligence, and is rapidly moving towards cognitive intelligence. AI has stepped from the 1.0 era, which is only recognized and used by elite minority groups, to the 2.0 era, which is widely used by all walks of life. With the rapid development and application of natural language understanding, facial expression recognition, educational data, virtual reality and robotics, the new intelligent teaching system after introducing these technologies is carrying out intelligent transformation and reconstruction of knowledge representation and learning process, and capturing and perceiving and analyzing learners' knowledge in real time. Learning state, automatic assessment, learning analysis, emotional perception, simulation teaching and intelligent companionship become the proper functions of intelligent teaching system. AI 2.0 will bring about great changes in the field of education. Teaching and learning are undergoing a series of changes, ranging from the generation and flow of knowledge, the form and interaction of learning, the form and construction of learning resources, the organization and implementation of teaching content, expert system, ubiquitous learning to the evaluation and management of teaching performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of intrinsic motivation in player modeling, with a focus on simulation-based game testing. Modern AI agents can learn to win many games; from a game testing perspective, a remaining research problem is how to model the aspects of human player behavior not explained by purely rational and goal-driven decision making. A major piece of this puzzle is constituted by intrinsic motivations, i.e., psychological needs that drive behavior without extrinsic reinforcement such as game score. We first review the common intrinsic motivations discussed in player psychology research and artificial intelligence, and then proceed to systematically review how the various motivations have been implemented in simulated player agents. Our work reveals that although motivations such as competence and curiosity have been studied in AI, work on utilizing them in simulation-based game testing is sparse, and other motivations such as social relatedness, immersion, and domination appear particularly underexplored.},

That embodiment will yield AI's that share our moral foundations, namely coordination, sociality, and acknowledgement of shared resources. Consequently, we can expect a broad moral alignment between human beings and AI's. AI's will likely show no more variation in their values than we find amongst human beings.},

abstract = {One of the key issues in cognitive development is discovering how infants come to have a representation of the external world they live in; a representation which will serve both as the framework around which to hang and organize sensory input, as well as a tool for understanding and planning external events which don't immediately involve sensations. More generally, it can be argued that any adaptive learning system must also face the task of generating a representation of its environment and establishing the constraints to guide its interaction with this environment. In psychology, two extreme positions have been historically championed: empiricism and nativism. Advocates of the later would argue that the child is initially born with no representational system and that it builds up such a system guided by practicce and experience with sensory input. Advocates of the former, however, would argue that raw sensory input is far too chaotic for any meaningful systematicity to be extracted from it. They would therefore claim that in order to interpret the world the child must have a fully developed innate representational system ready to cope with any conceivable situation. Made-up Minds is the account of Gary Drescher's attempt to implement a more moderate view first put forward by Kant and later adopted by the Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget: that of constructivism.},

The term knowledge representation will be used to refer to knowledge representation schemes, knowledge representation languages, and so on. The corresponding term in database modelling is data model or semantic data model. We're talking about natural ways of capturing some sort of reality using a specification language. The things produced when using a knowledge representation scheme are referred to as knowledge bases which correspond in database modelling and programming languages with conceptual schema and program specification respectively.What is a knowledge base? What is modelled by a knowledge base? I am happy to report that there is no one answer from people working in knowledge representation. Some people will argue that a knowledge base is a model of some world. Others will say that it is linguistic information about some world, and so on. Depending on the viewpoint, there are differences in knowledge representation schemes.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the buzzword of the last decade. Advances so far have been largely technical with a focus on machine learning (ML). Only recently have we begun seeing a shift towards focusing on the human aspects of artificial intelligence, centered on the narrow view of making AI interactive and explainable. In this paper I suggest a definition for "Interactive Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and outline the required properties. Staying in control is essential for humans to feel safe and have self-determination. Hence, we need to find ways for humans to understand AI based systems and means to allow human control and oversight. In our work, we argue that levels of abstractions and granularity of control are a general solution to this. Furthermore, it is essential that we make explicit why we want AI and what are the goals of AI research and development. We need to state the properties that we expect of future intelligent systems and who will benefit from a system or service. For me, AI and ML are very much comparable to raw materials (like stone, iron, or bronze). Historical periods are named after these materials as they fundamentally changed what humans can build and what tools humans can engineer. Hence, I argue that in the AI age we need to shift the focus from the material (e.g. the AI algorithms, as there will be plenty of material) towards the tools and infrastructures that are enabled which are beneficial to humans. It is apparent that AI will allow the automation of mental routine tasks and that it will extend our ability to perceive the world and foresee events. For me, the central question is how to create these tools for amplifying the human mind without compromising human values.},

The paper makes full use of the individual attributes of some psychological committee members of Wuhan University of Technology as well as questionnaire data on self-evaluation of each dimension embodying psychological capital. In addition, the data mining analysis is carried out through a combination of decision tree C5.0, factor analysis and neural network model. The study demonstrates that three psychological capital factors including responsibility, empathy, and capacity can be extracted and the general psychological committee members have a good psychological capital status. Psychological members with different reasons and time for serving vary largely in psychological capital, and whether they have participated in the theoretical training of psychological members emerges as a minor factor influencing on psychological capital, therefore, universities need to focus on the theoretical training of psychological members.},

abstract = {The core of this paper is to provide a framework for analyzing the naturalness and artificiality in terms of the new rising of square of opposition, which have fruitful results in doing conceptual analysis in many different disciplines. In this framework, we can deal with two perspectives of analyzing the concepts of naturalness and artificiality: (1) when we focus on intension perspective, the logical relations of natural- ness and artificiality by using the formal square of opposition with na\"{\i}ve set theory, the trivialization of the dichotomy of artificiality and naturalness in artificial intelligence will be made; (2) when we focus on extension perspective, with the concept of being natural in tandem with the concept of being artificial, we find that we need to elaborate the inherent inter- inclusive relationship between artificiality and naturalness, either by logical hexagon or by the SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation that we define, and a paradigm shift from GOFAI to emergentism AI occurs. On the above basis, we suggest that SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation will be a good preparatory work for the research of naturalness and artificiality.},

Drawing on Schema theory and theory of Computers Are Social Actors (CASA), this study used a survey-experiment that controlled for the identity of the artist (AI vs. Human) and presented participants with two types of artworks (AI-created vs. Human-created). After seeing images of six artworks created by either AI or human artists, participants (n = 288) were asked to evaluate the artistic value using a validated scale commonly employed among art professionals. The study found that human-created artworks and AI-created artworks were not judged to be equivalent in their artistic value. Additionally, knowing that a piece of art was created by AI did not, in general, influence participants’ evaluation of art pieces’ artistic value. However, having a schema that AI cannot make art significantly influenced evaluation. Implications of the findings for application and theory are discussed.},

abstract = {This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.},

The main intention of this paper is twofold. First, it will give an overview of the state-of-the-art in emotional intelligence research. Then, it will suggest a systematic order of research activities and steps with the idea of proposing an adequate framework for real-life applications. We recognize that it is necessary to apply specific methods for dynamic data analysis and pattern mining/recognition in order to identify and discover new knowledge from available emotional information and data sets. Finally, the paper will propose research activities in order to design an agent-based architecture, in which agents are capable of reasoning about and displaying some kind of emotions based on emotions detected in human speech, as well as online documents. This kind of virtual emotional agent could be employed in intelligent human-computer interaction, within areas such as tourism, education, and virtual cultural exhibitions.},

abstract = {Owing to the rich emerging multimedia applications and services in the past decade, super large amount of multimedia data has been produced for the purpose of advanced research in multimedia. Furthermore, multimedia research has made great progress on image/video content analysis, multimedia search and recommendation, multimedia streaming, multimedia content delivery etc. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone a "new" wave of development since being officially regarded as an academic discipline in 1950s, which should give credits to the extreme success of deep learning. Thus, one question naturally arises: What happens when multimedia meets Artificial Intelligence?To answer this question, this tutorial disseminates and promotes the concept of Multimedia Intelligence through discussing the mutual-influence between multimedia and Artificial Intelligence, which is an exciting and fast-growing research direction in both multimedia and machine learning. We will advocate novel, high-quality research findings, and innovative solutions to multimedia intelligence through exploring the mutual influences between multimedia and Artificial Intelligence from two aspects: i) multimedia drives Artificial Intelligence to experience a paradigm shift towards more explainability and ii) Artificial Intelligence in turn injects new ways of thinking for multimedia research. As such, these two aspects form a loop in which multimedia and Artificial Intelligence interactively enhance each other. In this tutorial, we discuss what and how efforts have been done in literature and share our insights on research directions that deserve further study to produce potentially profound impact on multimedia intelligence.This topic is at the core of the scope of ACM Multimedia, and is attractive to MM audience from both academia and industry.},

The World Wide Web is an enormous source of products and services available for people. There is a huge effort done by scientists towards the creation of effective strategies to personalize those products/services for each people interested in using them. By storing Personality Traits in User Profiles we intend to enable Recommender Systems in order to deduce more interesting recommendations for users acting proactively to offer them products/services as a consequence of a prediction of their future needs and behaviors. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose the interpretation, modeling, formalization, storing and application of Personality Traits in User Profile, followed by an experimentation developed in the context of Recommender Systems.},
