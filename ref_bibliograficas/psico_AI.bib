abstract = {"Treat pre-disease " is one of the important ideas of Chinese medicine culture, and it is a scientific view of health based on the overall health of the human body. The application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of psychological counseling is still in its infancy. The integration of "preventive treatment" in psychology is an important part of Chinese medicine culture and health management, and it is one of the important theoretical foundations for constructing the theoretical system of Chinese medicine health. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of psychological counseling on the basis of the idea of "preventive treatment". This article introduces the related applications of artificial intelligence technology in the field of mental health at home and abroad, studies the feasibility and difficulties of artificial intelligence in psychological counseling, and proposes the application of artificial intelligence in psychological counseling in the future Several countermeasures and suggestions.},

abstract = {Real-time strategy (RTS) games can be seen as simulating real and complex dynamic environments in a limited and small world, posing important challenges for the development of artificial intelligence. Existing applications of artificial intelligence technology in RTS games are not yet able to compete with professional human players. But there are already ways to control the macro of RTS games, and they can compete with amateur human players. RTS games are an excellent platform for testing artificial intelligence technology, and more and more smarter methods are being used in the overall control of it. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the artificial intelligence technologies used in RTS games in recent years, including the definition of RTS games, the challenges faced, the platform for research problems, and the artificial intelligence methods for problem solving. Finally, we propose the future research direction of real-time strategy games. This article provides a quick start guide for the researchers, the theoretical framework of the system and possible research directions.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in service-oriented businesses in the form of chatbots. A chatbot is a popular type of social AI that uses natural language processing to communicate with users. Past studies have shown discrepancies in terms of whether or not a chatbot should communicate and behave like a human. This article aims to explore these discrepancies in order to provide a theoretical contribution of a list of factors related to perceived humanness in chatbots and how these may consequently lead to a positive user experience. The results suggest that a chatbot should have the following characteristics: avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences; asking follow-up questions during decision-making processes and; providing an apology when the context is not comprehensible, followed by a question or a statement to dynamically move a conversation forward. These results may have implications for designers working in the field of AI as well as for the wider debates and the broader discourse around the adoption of AI in society.},

abstract = {We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform, PopBots, where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.},

We found some evidence that judgments about whether a patient should receive a kidney can be influenced by feedback about participants' own decision-making perceived to be given by AI, even if the feedback is entirely random. We also discovered different effects between assessments presented as being from human experts and assessments presented as being from AI.},

abstract = {To be able to examine large amounts of data in a timely manner in search of important evidence during crime investigations is essential to the success of computer forensic examinations. The limitations in time and resources, both computational and human, have a negative impact in the results obtained. Thus, better use of the resources available are necessary, beyond the capabilities of the currently used forensic tools. Herein, we describe the use of Artificial Intelligence in computer forensics through the development of a multiagent system and case-based reasoning. This system is composed of specialized intelligent agents that act based on the experts knowledge of the technical domain. Their goal is to analyze and correlate the data contained in the evidences of an investigation and based on its expertise, present the most interesting evidence to the human examiner, thus reducing the amount of data to be personally analyzed. The correlation feature helps to find links between evidences that can be easily overlooked by a human expert, specially due to the amount of data involved. This system has been tested using real data and the results were very positive when compared to those obtained by the human expert alone performing the same analysis.},
