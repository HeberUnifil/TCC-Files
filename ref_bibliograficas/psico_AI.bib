abstract = {"Treat pre-disease " is one of the important ideas of Chinese medicine culture, and it is a scientific view of health based on the overall health of the human body. The application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of psychological counseling is still in its infancy. The integration of "preventive treatment" in psychology is an important part of Chinese medicine culture and health management, and it is one of the important theoretical foundations for constructing the theoretical system of Chinese medicine health. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of psychological counseling on the basis of the idea of "preventive treatment". This article introduces the related applications of artificial intelligence technology in the field of mental health at home and abroad, studies the feasibility and difficulties of artificial intelligence in psychological counseling, and proposes the application of artificial intelligence in psychological counseling in the future Several countermeasures and suggestions.},

abstract = {Real-time strategy (RTS) games can be seen as simulating real and complex dynamic environments in a limited and small world, posing important challenges for the development of artificial intelligence. Existing applications of artificial intelligence technology in RTS games are not yet able to compete with professional human players. But there are already ways to control the macro of RTS games, and they can compete with amateur human players. RTS games are an excellent platform for testing artificial intelligence technology, and more and more smarter methods are being used in the overall control of it. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the artificial intelligence technologies used in RTS games in recent years, including the definition of RTS games, the challenges faced, the platform for research problems, and the artificial intelligence methods for problem solving. Finally, we propose the future research direction of real-time strategy games. This article provides a quick start guide for the researchers, the theoretical framework of the system and possible research directions.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in service-oriented businesses in the form of chatbots. A chatbot is a popular type of social AI that uses natural language processing to communicate with users. Past studies have shown discrepancies in terms of whether or not a chatbot should communicate and behave like a human. This article aims to explore these discrepancies in order to provide a theoretical contribution of a list of factors related to perceived humanness in chatbots and how these may consequently lead to a positive user experience. The results suggest that a chatbot should have the following characteristics: avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences; asking follow-up questions during decision-making processes and; providing an apology when the context is not comprehensible, followed by a question or a statement to dynamically move a conversation forward. These results may have implications for designers working in the field of AI as well as for the wider debates and the broader discourse around the adoption of AI in society.},

abstract = {We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform, PopBots, where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.},

The limitations in time and resources, both computational and human, have a negative impact in the results obtained. Thus, better use of the resources available are necessary, beyond the capabilities of the currently used forensic tools. Herein, we describe the use of Artificial Intelligence in computer forensics through the development of a multiagent system and case-based reasoning. This system is composed of specialized intelligent agents that act based on the experts knowledge of the technical domain. Their goal is to analyze and correlate the data contained in the evidences of an investigation and based on its expertise, present the most interesting evidence to the human examiner, thus reducing the amount of data to be personally analyzed. The correlation feature helps to find links between evidences that can be easily overlooked by a human expert, specially due to the amount of data involved. This system has been tested using real data and the results were very positive when compared to those obtained by the human expert alone performing the same analysis.},

This paper will review some of the psychological research on software engineering performed since the Garmisch Conference in 1968. This review will be organized under two of the psychological paradigms used in exploring programming problems: individual differences and cognitive science. The major theoretical and practical contributions of each area to the theory and practice of software engineering will be discussed. The review will end with a call for more research guided by the paradigm of cognitive science, since such results are the easiest to integrate with new developments in artificial intelligence and computer science theory.},

Nevertheless, the human- computer's multimodal interaction is actually a dynamic and evolutionary process, so there are still some difficult issues that need to be further explored such as how to comprehensively deal with the multimodal fusion data, adaptively consider the user's personalized habits, and precisely understand the expresser's intentions. NeuroManagement, an emerging interdisciplinary subject to study human's management based on neural mechanism, provides new theory and methodology for probing into the above issues. From the perspective of NeuroManagement, this keynote paper analyzes the user's neural mechanism of multimodal interactions, discusses the characteristics of neural activities in that process, and proposes a framework of intelligent computation method to understand and measure the user's intentions as well as his/her psychological states. In order to promote the interdisciplinary development of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, Neuroartificial Intelligence, a new subject field is proposed by this paper.},

In the past ten years, AI has gone through computational intelligence and perceptual intelligence, and is rapidly moving towards cognitive intelligence. AI has stepped from the 1.0 era, which is only recognized and used by elite minority groups, to the 2.0 era, which is widely used by all walks of life. With the rapid development and application of natural language understanding, facial expression recognition, educational data, virtual reality and robotics, the new intelligent teaching system after introducing these technologies is carrying out intelligent transformation and reconstruction of knowledge representation and learning process, and capturing and perceiving and analyzing learners' knowledge in real time. Learning state, automatic assessment, learning analysis, emotional perception, simulation teaching and intelligent companionship become the proper functions of intelligent teaching system. AI 2.0 will bring about great changes in the field of education. Teaching and learning are undergoing a series of changes, ranging from the generation and flow of knowledge, the form and interaction of learning, the form and construction of learning resources, the organization and implementation of teaching content, expert system, ubiquitous learning to the evaluation and management of teaching performance.},

abstract = {We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform, PopBots, where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of intrinsic motivation in player modeling, with a focus on simulation-based game testing. Modern AI agents can learn to win many games; from a game testing perspective, a remaining research problem is how to model the aspects of human player behavior not explained by purely rational and goal-driven decision making. A major piece of this puzzle is constituted by intrinsic motivations, i.e., psychological needs that drive behavior without extrinsic reinforcement such as game score. We first review the common intrinsic motivations discussed in player psychology research and artificial intelligence, and then proceed to systematically review how the various motivations have been implemented in simulated player agents. Our work reveals that although motivations such as competence and curiosity have been studied in AI, work on utilizing them in simulation-based game testing is sparse, and other motivations such as social relatedness, immersion, and domination appear particularly underexplored.},

In order to achieve intelligence in its full generality and adaptiveness, cognition in AI's will need to be embodied in the sense of the Embodied Cognition research program. That embodiment will yield AI's that share our moral foundations, namely coordination, sociality, and acknowledgement of shared resources. Consequently, we can expect a broad moral alignment between human beings and AI's. AI's will likely show no more variation in their values than we find amongst human beings.},

abstract = {One of the key issues in cognitive development is discovering how infants come to have a representation of the external world they live in; a representation which will serve both as the framework around which to hang and organize sensory input, as well as a tool for understanding and planning external events which don't immediately involve sensations. More generally, it can be argued that any adaptive learning system must also face the task of generating a representation of its environment and establishing the constraints to guide its interaction with this environment. In psychology, two extreme positions have been historically championed: empiricism and nativism. Advocates of the later would argue that the child is initially born with no representational system and that it builds up such a system guided by practicce and experience with sensory input. Advocates of the former, however, would argue that raw sensory input is far too chaotic for any meaningful systematicity to be extracted from it. They would therefore claim that in order to interpret the world the child must have a fully developed innate representational system ready to cope with any conceivable situation. Made-up Minds is the account of Gary Drescher's attempt to implement a more moderate view first put forward by Kant and later adopted by the Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget: that of constructivism.},

Many Software Engineering costs can be attributed to the ineffectiveness of current techniques for managing this knowledge, and Artificial Intelligence techniques can help alleviate this situation. More than two decades of research have led to many significant theoretical results, but few demonstrations of practical utility. This is due in part to the amount and diversity of knowledge required by Software Engineering activities, and in part to the fact that much of the research has been narrowly focused, missing many issues that are of great practical importance. Important issues that remain to be addressed include the representation and use of domain knowledge and the representation of the design and implementation history of a software system. If solutions to these issues are found, and experiments in practical situations are successful, the implications for the practice of Software Engineering will be profound, and radically different software development paradigms will become possible.},

The major impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research on simulation is to encourage the use of additional kinds of modeling based on inferencing, reasoning, search methods, and representations that have been developed in AI. This natural--though long overdue--extension of simulation can produce behavioral models that answer questions Beyond "What-if...?". The result is sometimes referred to as "Knowledge-Based Simulation". This tutorial presents some of the major concepts of Artificial Intelligence and illustrates their applicability to simulation using examples drawn from recent Knowledge-Based Simulation research. It focuses on the present state-of-the-art, current problems and limitations, and future directions and possibilities.},

These environments should be aware of the needs of people, customizing requirements and forecasting behaviours. AmI environments may be so diverse, such as homes, offices, meeting rooms, schools, hospitals, control centers, transports, touristic attractions, stores, sport installations, music devices, etc. In the aims of Ambient Intelligence, research envisages to include more intelligence in the AmI environments, allowing a better support to the human being and the access to the essential knowledge to make better decisions when interacting with these environments. This paper can be seen as a State of the Art of Ambient Intelligence, according to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) perspective. We will define Ambient Intelligence; refer some of their prototype and systems; and to analyze how the main Artificial Intelligence areas can be applied.},

This article presents a general methodological approach to take into account the ethical aspect of the introduction of a new technology in a given domain. We apply this methodology in the specific case of the introduction of AI technologies in the law system. As a multidisciplinary working group interested in this application in the case of France, we have organized a series of workshops to discuss this topic and highlight the respective values and interests of each stakeholder. The result of this work in presented in the form of an ethical matrix that can be used as a tool by the public authorities to help decision-making on the subject with a prioritization of certain values in order to reflect the respect for fundamental rights.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the buzzword of the last decade. Advances so far have been largely technical with a focus on machine learning (ML). Only recently have we begun seeing a shift towards focusing on the human aspects of artificial intelligence, centered on the narrow view of making AI interactive and explainable. In this paper I suggest a definition for "Interactive Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and outline the required properties. Staying in control is essential for humans to feel safe and have self-determination. Hence, we need to find ways for humans to understand AI based systems and means to allow human control and oversight. In our work, we argue that levels of abstractions and granularity of control are a general solution to this. Furthermore, it is essential that we make explicit why we want AI and what are the goals of AI research and development. We need to state the properties that we expect of future intelligent systems and who will benefit from a system or service. For me, AI and ML are very much comparable to raw materials (like stone, iron, or bronze). Historical periods are named after these materials as they fundamentally changed what humans can build and what tools humans can engineer. Hence, I argue that in the AI age we need to shift the focus from the material (e.g. the AI algorithms, as there will be plenty of material) towards the tools and infrastructures that are enabled which are beneficial to humans. It is apparent that AI will allow the automation of mental routine tasks and that it will extend our ability to perceive the world and foresee events. For me, the central question is how to create these tools for amplifying the human mind without compromising human values.},

The paper makes full use of the individual attributes of some psychological committee members of Wuhan University of Technology as well as questionnaire data on self-evaluation of each dimension embodying psychological capital. In addition, the data mining analysis is carried out through a combination of decision tree C5.0, factor analysis and neural network model. The study demonstrates that three psychological capital factors including responsibility, empathy, and capacity can be extracted and the general psychological committee members have a good psychological capital status. Psychological members with different reasons and time for serving vary largely in psychological capital, and whether they have participated in the theoretical training of psychological members emerges as a minor factor influencing on psychological capital, therefore, universities need to focus on the theoretical training of psychological members.},

In this framework, we can deal with two perspectives of analyzing the concepts of naturalness and artificiality: (1) when we focus on intension perspective, the logical relations of natural- ness and artificiality by using the formal square of opposition with na\"{\i}ve set theory, the trivialization of the dichotomy of artificiality and naturalness in artificial intelligence will be made; (2) when we focus on extension perspective, with the concept of being natural in tandem with the concept of being artificial, we find that we need to elaborate the inherent inter- inclusive relationship between artificiality and naturalness, either by logical hexagon or by the SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation that we define, and a paradigm shift from GOFAI to emergentism AI occurs. On the above basis, we suggest that SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation will be a good preparatory work for the research of naturalness and artificiality.},

After seeing images of six artworks created by either AI or human artists, participants (n = 288) were asked to evaluate the artistic value using a validated scale commonly employed among art professionals. The study found that human-created artworks and AI-created artworks were not judged to be equivalent in their artistic value. Additionally, knowing that a piece of art was created by AI did not, in general, influence participants’ evaluation of art pieces’ artistic value. However, having a schema that AI cannot make art significantly influenced evaluation. Implications of the findings for application and theory are discussed.},

abstract = {This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.},

abstract = {Artificial agents are now increasingly part of human society, destined for schools, hospitals, and homes to perform a variety of tasks. To engage their human users, artificial agents must be equipped with essential social skills such as facial expression communication. However, many artificial agents remain limited in this ability because they are typically equipped with a narrow set of prototypical Western-centric facial expressions of emotion that lack naturalistic dynamics. Our aim is to address this challenge by equipping artificial agents with a broader repertoire of socially relevant and culturally sensitive facial expressions (e.g., complex emotions, conversational messages, social and personality traits). To this aim, we use new, data-driven and psychology-based methodologies that can reverse-engineer dynamic facial expressions using human cultural perception. We show that our human-user-centered approach can reverse engineer many different, highly recognizable, and human-like dynamic facial expressions that typically outperform the facial expressions of existing artificial agents. By objectively analyzing these dynamic facial expression models, we can also identify specific latent syntactical signalling structures that can inform the design of generative models for culture-specific and universal social face signalling. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of an interdisciplinary approach that applies data-driven, psychology-based methods to inform the social signalling generation capabilities of artificial agents. We anticipate that these methods will broaden the usability and global marketability of artificial agents and highlight the key role that psychology must continue to play in their design.},

abstract = {Recently, research on emotional intelligence has advanced significantly from its theoretical basis, analytical studies and processing technology to exploratory application. The main intention of this paper is twofold. First, it will give an overview of the state-of-the-art in emotional intelligence research. Then, it will suggest a systematic order of research activities and steps with the idea of proposing an adequate framework for real-life applications. We recognize that it is necessary to apply specific methods for dynamic data analysis and pattern mining/recognition in order to identify and discover new knowledge from available emotional information and data sets. Finally, the paper will propose research activities in order to design an agent-based architecture, in which agents are capable of reasoning about and displaying some kind of emotions based on emotions detected in human speech, as well as online documents. This kind of virtual emotional agent could be employed in intelligent human-computer interaction, within areas such as tourism, education, and virtual cultural exhibitions.},

abstract = {Owing to the rich emerging multimedia applications and services in the past decade, super large amount of multimedia data has been produced for the purpose of advanced research in multimedia. Furthermore, multimedia research has made great progress on image/video content analysis, multimedia search and recommendation, multimedia streaming, multimedia content delivery etc. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone a "new" wave of development since being officially regarded as an academic discipline in 1950s, which should give credits to the extreme success of deep learning. Thus, one question naturally arises: What happens when multimedia meets Artificial Intelligence?To answer this question, this tutorial disseminates and promotes the concept of Multimedia Intelligence through discussing the mutual-influence between multimedia and Artificial Intelligence, which is an exciting and fast-growing research direction in both multimedia and machine learning. We will advocate novel, high-quality research findings, and innovative solutions to multimedia intelligence through exploring the mutual influences between multimedia and Artificial Intelligence from two aspects: i) multimedia drives Artificial Intelligence to experience a paradigm shift towards more explainability and ii) Artificial Intelligence in turn injects new ways of thinking for multimedia research. As such, these two aspects form a loop in which multimedia and Artificial Intelligence interactively enhance each other. In this tutorial, we discuss what and how efforts have been done in literature and share our insights on research directions that deserve further study to produce potentially profound impact on multimedia intelligence.This topic is at the core of the scope of ACM Multimedia, and is attractive to MM audience from both academia and industry.},

In the new era, the management of mass media censorship system in Mainland China is changing through artificial intelligence. The media industry has become more convenient and effective from editing to censorship by using artificial intelligence technology. In the future, the researcher thinks facial recognition could even be used to aid the implementation of "Motion Picture Content Rating System" in Mainland China. Therefore, artificial intelligence will continue to promote the progress of the censorship system of mass media in Mainland China and become the driving force for the booming development of mass media in Mainland China under the new era. This paper will summarize the history of the censorship system of mass media and analyzes the development of the censorship system management of mass media in Mainland China, as well as discuss the using of artificial intelligence and the possibility of its future use.},

But relations were not always so auspicious. The two fields emerged at different points in the history of computer science, with different influences, ambitions, and attendant biases. AI aimed to construct a rival, and perhaps a successor, to the human intellect. Early AI researchers such as McCarthy, Minsky, and Shannon were mathematicians by training, so theorem-proving and formal models were attractive research directions. In contrast, HCI focused more on empirical approaches to usability and human factors, both of which generally aim to make machines more useful to humans. Many of the attendees at the first CHI conference in 1983 were psychologists and engineers. Papers were presented with titles such as "Design principles for human-computer interfaces" and "Psychological issues in the use of icons in command menus," hardly appealing fare for most mainstream AI researchers.},

abstract = {Recents studies have demonstrated how useful and fundamental psychological aspects such as people Personality Traits and Emotions are during human decision-making process. Some research towards the identification and model of user's Emotions have been done by Affective Computing researchers, however Personality Traits have been quite neglected. The World Wide Web is an enormous source of products and services available for people. There is a huge effort done by scientists towards the creation of effective strategies to personalize those products/services for each people interested in using them. By storing Personality Traits in User Profiles we intend to enable Recommender Systems in order to deduce more interesting recommendations for users acting proactively to offer them products/services as a consequence of a prediction of their future needs and behaviors. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose the interpretation, modeling, formalization, storing and application of Personality Traits in User Profile, followed by an experimentation developed in the context of Recommender Systems.},
