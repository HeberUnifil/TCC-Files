abstract = {"Treat pre-disease " is one of the important ideas of Chinese medicine culture, and it is a scientific view of health based on the overall health of the human body. The application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of psychological counseling is still in its infancy. The integration of "preventive treatment" in psychology is an important part of Chinese medicine culture and health management, and it is one of the important theoretical foundations for constructing the theoretical system of Chinese medicine health. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of psychological counseling on the basis of the idea of "preventive treatment". This article introduces the related applications of artificial intelligence technology in the field of mental health at home and abroad, studies the feasibility and difficulties of artificial intelligence in psychological counseling, and proposes the application of artificial intelligence in psychological counseling in the future Several countermeasures and suggestions.},

abstract = {The advent of the era of big data has brought opportunities for the application of artificial intelligence and mental health. From "virtual psychotherapists" to social robots for dementia and autism treatment to robots for treatment of disorders, AI is innovating traditional models of mental illness prevention and treatment with high levels of treatment and interventions. This paper summarizes the research progress of artificial intelligence in mental illness group, including the current situation of the application of mental illness prevention, diagnosis, treatment and nursing, and discusses the advantages, disadvantages and prospects of the application of artificial intelligence in the field of mental illness, hoping to provide reference for the sustainable development of this field.},

abstract = {At present, students' psychological problems have become a topic of widespread concern in the society. The psychological consultation room plays a relatively weak role, and modern information technology must be used in establishing a more complete psychological counseling service to promote students' psychological problems solving. This paper designs a campus psychological education service system based on Android. It is the application of network technology to provide a convenient and implicit way for college students' psychological consultation private and efficient consulting platform. The client is based on the business requirements of the psychological counseling service centers. Combining the knowledge of Android platform development and the knowledge of software engineering development process, this paper aims at solving the low efficiency of current psychological counseling service and promoting the popularization and popularization of psychological consultation content. In the process of the design and development of the consulting service system, the related technology, business process, content and the interface division of the system are analyzed in detail. This paper analyzes and designs the architecture of the system, the system network topology, the system database design, and the details of the deployment plan. The design and implementation of the development platform is Android and Eclipse, based on C/S architecture implementation.},

abstract = {Since the 1950's, psychologists have studied the behavioral aspects of software engineering. However, the results of their research have never been organized into a subfield of either software engineering or psychology. This failure results from the difficulty of integrating theory and data from the mixture of paradigms borrowed from psychology. This paper will review some of the psychological research on software engineering performed since the Garmisch Conference in 1968. This review will be organized under two of the psychological paradigms used in exploring programming problems: individual differences and cognitive science. The major theoretical and practical contributions of each area to the theory and practice of software engineering will be discussed. The review will end with a call for more research guided by the paradigm of cognitive science, since such results are the easiest to integrate with new developments in artificial intelligence and computer science theory.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced more than 60 years of development and accumulated a strong technical foundation. In the past ten years, AI has gone through computational intelligence and perceptual intelligence, and is rapidly moving towards cognitive intelligence. AI has stepped from the 1.0 era, which is only recognized and used by elite minority groups, to the 2.0 era, which is widely used by all walks of life. With the rapid development and application of natural language understanding, facial expression recognition, educational data, virtual reality and robotics, the new intelligent teaching system after introducing these technologies is carrying out intelligent transformation and reconstruction of knowledge representation and learning process, and capturing and perceiving and analyzing learners' knowledge in real time. Learning state, automatic assessment, learning analysis, emotional perception, simulation teaching and intelligent companionship become the proper functions of intelligent teaching system. AI 2.0 will bring about great changes in the field of education. Teaching and learning are undergoing a series of changes, ranging from the generation and flow of knowledge, the form and interaction of learning, the form and construction of learning resources, the organization and implementation of teaching content, expert system, ubiquitous learning to the evaluation and management of teaching performance.},

The possibility of creating intelligent machines has been a motivating force behind a great deal of computing machine development. The methods of AI are not only of historical interest, but are powerful in themselves. Artificial Intelligence therefore deserves a prominent place in the undergraduate Computer Science curriculum. This paper discusses the pedagogical advantages of emphasizing AI in upper level courses, reasons for its present neglect, and the importance of introducing AI study.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the buzzword of the last decade. Advances so far have been largely technical with a focus on machine learning (ML). Only recently have we begun seeing a shift towards focusing on the human aspects of artificial intelligence, centered on the narrow view of making AI interactive and explainable. In this paper I suggest a definition for "Interactive Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and outline the required properties. Staying in control is essential for humans to feel safe and have self-determination. Hence, we need to find ways for humans to understand AI based systems and means to allow human control and oversight. In our work, we argue that levels of abstractions and granularity of control are a general solution to this. Furthermore, it is essential that we make explicit why we want AI and what are the goals of AI research and development. We need to state the properties that we expect of future intelligent systems and who will benefit from a system or service. For me, AI and ML are very much comparable to raw materials (like stone, iron, or bronze). Historical periods are named after these materials as they fundamentally changed what humans can build and what tools humans can engineer. Hence, I argue that in the AI age we need to shift the focus from the material (e.g. the AI algorithms, as there will be plenty of material) towards the tools and infrastructures that are enabled which are beneficial to humans. It is apparent that AI will allow the automation of mental routine tasks and that it will extend our ability to perceive the world and foresee events. For me, the central question is how to create these tools for amplifying the human mind without compromising human values.},
